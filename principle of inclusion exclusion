Computes the size of the set resulting from union of some sets:
| A1 U A2 U A3 U.. U An | 
= sum of single intersections - sum of pair intersections + sum of triplet intersections - sum of quadruplet intersections ... until the full intersection


| A1 U A2 U A3 | = |A1| + |A2| + |A3| - ( |A1 ∩ A2| + |A1 ∩ A3| + |A2 ∩ A3| ) + (|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3|)

Use cases:
* Same principle applies for probabilities.
1- Upper bound integer sums:

x1 + x2 + x3+..+xk = S , but 0 <= xi <= B


2- The number of relative primes in a given interval
Task: given two numbers  n  and  r , count the number of integers in the interval  
[1 : r]  that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is  1).

-> Inverse the problem (all - bad)
